Thruster Cooldown System
1. Create guage meter UI
2. Allow player to hold shift for 3 seconds. While shift is being pressed, meter will fill up quickly.
3. Then at the beginning of the 3rd second, there's a cooldown period for 20 seconds.
3. During cooldown period, the bar slowly empties.

Misc:
1. See if I can remove the Wave Attack script from the Player.
2. Learn new input system.
3. Fix delay in movement.
